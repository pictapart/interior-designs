<p>The 24 tower features one hanging rod, one top shelf, and two adjustable shelves, and three drawers for organizing folded clothes, shoes, or accessories. We design, build, and install closet organizers. We measured my desk and determined the hight we wanted. So we started out this project with a sheet of plywood that we cut to the width and just shy of the depth of the closet.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-teeny-tiny-room-and-space-is-at-a-premium">It’s a teeny, tiny room and space is at a premium.</h3><p>I wanted enough height between the desk and the first shelf for my computer monitor, and enough room above the upper shelf to fit the boxes i previously had in the closet. Closet, wardrobe drawers, vanity table, study desk, shoe storage, side tables, and even the bed itself. With all this in mind, i marked the height for the desk and shelves inside the closet. Lucky for me, i have a handy husband who was more than willing to build me said craft closet as a christmas gift! One of the most important parts of my office &amp; craft room makeover was a desk. Or is your closet more of a cupboard or an alcove, in which case you might want to get your diy on.</p>
