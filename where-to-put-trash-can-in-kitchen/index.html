<p>We dont have a garbage can in the kitchen. By the way, you can create this trash bin on your own. The best place for a bin is in the cleaning zone; This is a rather focused version of the question “why do people not put things away after them”. It limits your trash can options.</p>

<p>A small and stylish trash can is put between the fridge and the cooker and it�s not seen. You can put the kitchen supplies as well in the counter; They want it on the periphery of the kitchen or prep. My daughter has moved in with me and has decided she doesn’t like having the garbage in the kitchen, where.</p>
